## DUNE Computing Consortium

The goal of the DUNE Computing Consortium is to establish a global computing network that can handle the massive data dumps DUNE will produce by distributing them across the grid. It coordinates all DUNE computing activities and provides to new members the documentation and training to acquaint them with the specific and DUNE software and resources.

Coordinator: Heidi Schellman (Oregon State University)

## Welcome Session Video


The session will be captured on video a placed here after the workshop for asynchronous study.
<!---The sessions was video captured for your asynchronous review. The video from the full two day training in May 2022 is provided here as a reference.--->

## Schedule

This training is designed as a quick introduction or review, lasting four hours.  Sessions will be recorded for review afterwards.

This event is also hosted on [Indico][indico-event-link].


<!--- for each [Zoom][zoom-link] session. --->
<!--The official schedule for this training is on the TBA Indico site --->  <!--- [Indico site](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/54191/timetable/#20220512). --->

## Support

Throughout the training, participants are free to ask questions via a Google Live doc associate with each topic:

- Topic 1: [Storage Space and Data Management][live-doc-storage-space-and-data-management]
- Topic 2: [LArSoft][live-doc-LArSoft]
- Topic 3: [Grid Job Submission][live-doc-grid-job-submission]

You can write questions there, anonymously or not, and experts will reply. This method is preferred as the chat on Zoom can quickly saturate so this method proved to be successful at the previous training. We will collect all questions and release a Q&A after the event.

You can join DUNE's Slack: `dunescience.slack.com`. We created a special channel `#computing_training_basics` for technical support, join [here][slack-join-link].
